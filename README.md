## Reflection
**Total Points Claimed**: [Base: 80% + Extensions: X% = Total%]
**Challenges**: One of the most difficult parts was diving into the code someone else had written and understanding what every part of it meant. Whei I wanted to change something about the game I had to do wuite a lot of searching through files to find where specific things happened.
**Learning Outcomes**: [What you learned]

## Development Notes
I think I would much rather have created my own game from scratch, however given the time constraints of the assignment I know it wouldn't have been at this lavel had I done so.
